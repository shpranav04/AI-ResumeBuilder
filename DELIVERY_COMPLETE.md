## 🎬 PRESENTATION SCRIPT

### 30-Second Pitch
"I built an AI-powered resume builder that helps users optimize their resumes for ATS. It features intelligent suggestions powered by Google Gemini, real-time ATS scoring with visual heatmaps, and a recruiter-mode preview. Built with FastAPI, React, and modern design patterns."

### 5-Minute Demo

2. Add content → Show live preview
3. Paste job description → Check ATS score
4. Click "Improve" button → Show AI suggestion
5. Apply change → Show before/after
6. View recruiter mode → Show ATS parsing
7. Display heatmap → Show section strengths
8. Export PDF → Show result

### Technical Deep Dive
1. Architecture: FastAPI backend, React frontend
2. Database: SQLAlchemy with 3 models
3. API: 20+ RESTful endpoints
4. AI: Gemini integration with retry logic
5. Scoring: 5-dimension algorithm
6. Features: 25+ core + 8 WOW features
